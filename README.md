<p align="center"><b>Machine Learning Internship – Hunar Intern</b></p>

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains my submission for **Task 3 (Challenging Level)** of the **Machine Learning Internship** at **Hunar Intern**.

The objective of this task was to build a classification model using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm to predict whether a tumor is **Malignant (M)** or **Benign (B)** based on real-world medical data.

---

## ✅ Task Highlights

- Removed unnecessary columns (like `id`)
- Converted categorical labels (M/B) to numeric values (1/0)
- Scaled features using `StandardScaler`
- Trained a **KNN classifier** using `scikit-learn`
- Evaluated the model using:
  - Accuracy Score
  - Classification Report
  - Confusion Matrix
- Tested prediction with a new sample input
